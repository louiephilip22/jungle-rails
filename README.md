## OBS

## MailCatcher

MailCatcher runs a super simple SMTP server which catches any message sent to it to display in a web interface.

Bundler

Please don't put mailcatcher into your Gemfile. It will conflict with your applications gems at some point.

Instead, pop a note in your README stating you use mailcatcher. Simply run `gem install mailcatcher` then `mailcatcher` to get started.

AND

I confirm that, on a Vagrant Ubuntu VM it works by :

adding a port forwarding in Vagrantfile
=> `config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 1080, host: 1080`
launching mailcatcher
=> `mailcatcher --ip=0.0.0.0`
