## Instrutions for email testing

### MailCatcher

MailCatcher runs a super simple SMTP server which catches any message sent to it to display in a web interface.

#### Bundler

Please don't put mailcatcher into your Gemfile. It will conflict with your applications gems at some point.

Instead, pop a note in your README stating you use mailcatcher. Simply run `gem install mailcatcher` then `mailcatcher` to get started.

More information <https://mailcatcher.me>

#### And

On a Vagrant Ubuntu VM it works by :

adding a port forwarding in Vagrantfile
=> `config.vm.network :forwarded_port, host: 1080, guest: 1080`
launching mailcatcher
=> `mailcatcher --ip=0.0.0.0` - remark: Do not set only http with command `mailcatcher --http-ip=0.0.0.0`
